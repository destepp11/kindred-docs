###(Thief)
 Description:
> He has low attack and defense stats, however his speed, intelligence, and dexterity make up for it. High speeds allows the thief to distract the enemy long enough for the stronger members of the party to attack. Witty and cunning, the thief provides comic relief to the story. He can help your party steal items from enemies and win gold from high-stakes games.  However, he can sometimes lose as well.
