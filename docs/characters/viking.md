###(Viking)
Description:
>  He wields axes and hammers better than any other class. A HP and strength powerhouse, the Viking is plagued by slow speed and poor evade. The Viking's sea legs and blacksmith's anvil makes him indispensable to the party. The only thing that the Viking enjoys more than a fight is beer, maybe  a nap as well. Don't play tricks on him while he's asleep, he can get awfully angry.
