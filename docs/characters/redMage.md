 Story:
> She is the daughter of the second steward of Quesilla. Well-versed in combat  and magic she wants to regain her city and restore it to glory. Incredible optimistic, the rest of the party shuts her out when the situation is grim.

Description:
> > Able to cast low level black and white spells and wield a diverse array of weapons, the Red Mage is a "jack-of-all-trades." This quality however makes them less powerful at each individual skill. One special attack is "Chainspell," which cast spells on multiple targets.
