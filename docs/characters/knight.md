Duke Hamiltonâ€™s wife died in child birth along with the the child, when Amell was just 3 year old. With no motherly figure around and the pressure of military life from his father, Amell keeps his emotions in a shell. He looks upon people as numbers and embodiments of skills.

Prince Albert is envious of the relationship between Amell and King Nikomedes.
